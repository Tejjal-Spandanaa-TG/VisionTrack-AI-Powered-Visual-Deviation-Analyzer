# VisionTrack – AI-based Visual Deviation Analyzer

VisionTrack is a frontend-only web application designed to detect visual differences between before-and-after images. It highlights deviations using simulated heatmap overlays and provides a structured summary of detected changes. This project focuses entirely on the user interface and does not include any backend or machine learning model integration.

## Overview

VisionTrack demonstrates how visual difference detection can streamline inspections in manufacturing, infrastructure monitoring, and brand compliance. The application identifies visual deviations, highlights affected regions, and provides a structured summary of detected changes.

## Features

* Upload two images (Before and After)
* Side-by-side or overlay comparison view
* "Detect Changes" button with simulated AI output
* Heatmap-style highlight simulation
* Text-based detection summary
* Clean user interface using React and TailwindCSS
* Fully responsive and deployable on Vercel

## Technology Stack

* React (Single-Page Application)
* TailwindCSS for styling
* Framer Motion for animations (optional)
* No backend required; all detection is simulated
